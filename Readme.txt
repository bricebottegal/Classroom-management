Description: classroom management is an application to easily manage the booking of one or more classrooms. There are two distinct groups, teachers and administrators. The teachers once identified can book a classroom. An email is sent or not according to script configuration to the administrator informing him of the request. The administrator validates or rejects the booking request and the teacher is informed of his decision with an email. A protected administration section is available to add, edit and delete users or rooms.
